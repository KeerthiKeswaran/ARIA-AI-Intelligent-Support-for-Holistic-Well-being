### ARIA AI: Adaptive Response & Insight Assistant  

**Project Overview:**  
ARIA AI is an innovative mobile application designed to address the challenges faced by underserved and economically disadvantaged communities in managing personal health and lifestyle. By integrating real-time data collection, AI-driven recommendations, and an interactive user interface, ARIA empowers individuals to make informed decisions tailored to their specific environments and health conditions.  

**Core Features:**  
- **Dynamic Recommendation Engine:** Powered by the fine-tuned Gemma-2B language model, ARIA delivers context-aware and personalized health, dietary, and wellness recommendations. The engine dynamically adapts to changes in user environments and preferences.  
- **Real-Time Data Integration:** The application gathers and processes location-based environmental data, including air quality, safety indicators, and local healthcare facility availability, ensuring personalized and relevant insights.  
- **Holistic Health Management:** From providing tailored advice for work-life balance and dietary choices to mental health assistance and chronic condition care, ARIA addresses diverse user needs comprehensively.  
- **Interactive Dashboard:** Users access forecasts and daily updates about their health and surroundings through an intuitive dashboard, fostering proactive health management.  
- **CI/CD Pipeline:** A robust pipeline enables periodic model fine-tuning, ensuring ARIA's recommendation system evolves continuously, providing more accurate and effective solutions over time.  

**Technical Stack:**  
- **Frontend:** Built with React Native, offering a seamless cross-platform experience for iOS and Android users.  
- **Backend:** FastAPI ensures efficient and high-performance web services.  
- **Database:** Neo4j's graph database facilitates complex and interconnected health data management.  
- **API:** GraphQL enhances data flexibility, enabling tailored responses to user queries.  
- **Transformer Model:** Gemma-2B, fine-tuned for healthcare applications, drives the recommendation engine with precision and efficiency.  

**Key Innovations:**  
1. **Advanced Fine-Tuning:** Leveraging Parameter-Efficient Fine-Tuning (PEFT) techniques like Low-Rank Adaptation (LoRA), ARIA optimizes computational resources while maintaining high model performance.  
2. **Transfer Learning Pipeline:** The application evolves through continuous data integration and model retraining, ensuring relevance in dynamic user environments.  
3. **Environmental Context Awareness:** By combining real-time environmental and user-specific data, ARIA provides actionable insights that align with users' lifestyles and external conditions.  

**Impact:**  
ARIA AI aspires to bridge the gap in healthcare accessibility for low-income populations by delivering technology-driven, personalized, and actionable health recommendations. Through its user-centric approach, the application fosters better health management and proactive care, making healthcare more inclusive and impactful.
